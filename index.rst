The ros2_control is a framework for (real-time) control of robots using (`ROS2 <https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/>`_).
Its packages are a rewrite of `ros_control <http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control>`_ packages used in `ROS` (`Robot Operating System <https://wiki.ros.org>`_).
ros2_control's goal is to simplify integrating new hardware and overcome some drawbacks.

If you are not familiar with the control theory, please get some idea about it (e.g., at `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory>`_) to get familiar with the terms used in this manual.


Overview
=========
The ros2_control framework consists of the following Github repositories:

* `ros2_control`_ - the main interfaces and components of the framework;
* `ros2_controllers`_ - widely used controllers, such as forward command controller, joint trajectory controller, differential drive controller;
* `control_toolbox`_ - some widely-used control theory implementations (e.g. PID) used by controllers;
* `realtime_tools`_ - general toolkit for realtime support, e.g., realtime buffers and publishers;
* `control_msgs`_ - common messages.


Additionally, there are following (unreleased) packages are relevant for getting-started and project management:

* `ros2_control_demos`_ - examples implementations of common use-cases for a smooth start;
* `roadmap`_ - planning and design docs for the project.

Development Organisation and Communication
-------------------------------------------

WG Meeting
   Every second Wednesday there is a Working Group meeting.
   To join the meeting check the announcement on `ROS Discourse`_.
   You can joint the meeting through `google groups <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ros-control-working-group-invites>`_ or directly on Google Meet (check the announcement).
   To propose new discussion points, or review notes from previous meetings, check `this document <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1818AoYucI2z82awL_-8sAA5pMCV_g_wXCJiM6SQmhSQ/edit?usp=sharing>`_.

Projects
   GitHub `projects under ros-control organization <https://github.com/orgs/ros-controls/projects>`_ are used to track the work.
