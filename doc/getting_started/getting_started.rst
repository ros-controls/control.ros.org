Installation
============

Binary packages
------------------
The ros2_control framework is released for ROS 2 {DISTRO}.
To use it, you have to install ``ros-{DISTRO}-ros2-control`` and ``ros-{DISTRO}-ros2-controllers`` packages.

Building from Source
---------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <a href="https://github.com/ros-controls/control.ros.org/actions/workflows/{DISTRO}-binary-build-main.yml">
        <img src="https://github.com/ros-controls/control.ros.org/actions/workflows/{DISTRO}-binary-build-main.yml/badge.svg" alt="{DISTRO} Binary Build - main"/></a>

If you want to install the framework from source, e.g., for contributing to the framework, use the following commands:

* Download all repositories

  .. code-block:: shell

    mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
    cd ~/ros2_ws/
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-controls/control.ros.org/master/ros_controls.$ROS_DISTRO.repos
    vcs import src < ros_controls.$ROS_DISTRO.repos

* Install dependencies:

  .. code-block:: shell

    rosdep update --rosdistro=$ROS_DISTRO
    sudo apt-get update
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

* Build everything, e.g. with:

  .. code-block:: shell

    . /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.sh
    colcon build --symlink-install

* Do not forget to source ``setup.bash`` from the ``install`` folder!


Architecture
============
The source code for the ros2_control framework can be found in the `ros2_control`_ and `ros2_controllers`_ GitHub repositories.The following figure shows the architecture of the ros2_control framework.

|ros2_control_architecture|

Controller Manager
------------------
The `Controller Manager`_ (CM) connects the controllers and hardware-abstraction sides of the ros2_control framework.
It also serves as the entry-point for users via ROS services.
The CM implements a node without an executor so that it can be integrated into a custom setup.
However, it's usually recommended to use the default node-setup implemented in `ros2_control_node <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/blob/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/controller_manager/src/ros2_control_node.cpp>`_ file from the ``controller_manager`` package.
This manual assumes that you use this default node-setup.

On the one hand, CM manages (e.g. loads, activates, deactivates, unloads) controllers and the interfaces they require.
On the other hand, it has access (via the Resource Manager) to the hardware components, i.e. their interfaces.
The Controller Manager matches *required* and *provided* interfaces, granting controllers access to hardware when enabled, or reporting an error if there is an access conflict.


The execution of the control-loop is managed by the CM's ``update()`` method.
It reads data from the hardware components, updates outputs of all active controllers, and writes the result to the components.

Resource Manager
----------------
The `Resource Manager`_ (RM) abstracts physical hardware and its drivers (called *hardware components*) for the ros2_control framework.
The RM loads the components using the ``pluginlib``-library, manages their lifecycle and components' state and command interfaces.
The abstraction provided by RM allows reuse of implemented hardware components, e.g., robot and gripper, without any implementation, and flexible hardware application for state and command interfaces, e.g., separate hardware/communication libraries for motor control and encoder reading.

In the control loop execution, the RM's ``read()`` and ``write()`` methods handle the communication with the hardware components.

.. _overview-controllers:

Controllers
-----------
The controllers in the ros2_control framework are based on control theory. They compare the reference value with the measured output and, based on this error, calculate a system's input.
The controllers are objects derived from `ControllerInterface`_ (``controller_interface`` package in `ros2_control`_) and exported as plugins using ``pluginlib``-library.
For an example of a controller check the `ForwardCommandController implementation`_ in the `ros2_controllers`_ repository.
The controller lifecycle is based on the LifecycleNode class, which implements the state machine described in the Node Lifecycle Design document.

When the control-loop is executed, the ``update()`` method is called.
This method can access the latest hardware state and enable the controller to write to the hardware command interfaces.

User Interfaces
---------------
Users interact with the ros2_control framework using `Controller Manager`_'s services.
For a list of services and their definitions, check the ``srv`` folder in the `controller_manager_msgs`_ package.

While service calls can be used directly from the command line or via nodes, there exists a user-friendly ``Command Line Interface`` (CLI) which integrates with the ``ros2 cli``. This supports auto-complete and has a range of common commands available. The base command is ``ros2 control``.
For the description of our CLI capabilities, see the ``README.md`` file of the `ros2controlcli`_ package.

.. _overview_hardware_components:

Hardware Components
===================
The *hardware components* realize communication to physical hardware and represent its abstraction in the ros2_control framework.
The components have to be exported as plugins using ``pluginlib``-library.
The `Resource Manager`_ dynamically loads those plugins and manages their lifecycle.

There are three basic types of components:

System
  Complex (multi-DOF) robotic hardware like industrial robots.
  The main difference between the *Actuator* component is the possibility to use complex transmissions like needed for humanoid robot's hands.
  This component has reading and writing capabilities.
  It is used when there is only one logical communication channel to the hardware (e.g., KUKA-RSI).

Sensor
  Robotic hardware is used for sensing its environment.
  A sensor component is related to a joint (e.g., encoder) or a link (e.g., force-torque sensor).
  This component type has only reading capabilities.

Actuator
  Simple (1 DOF) robotic hardware like motors, valves, and similar.
  An actuator implementation is related to only one joint.
  This component type has reading and writing capabilities. Reading is not mandatory if not possible (e.g., DC motor control with Arduino board).
  The actuator type can also be used with a multi-DOF robot if its hardware enables modular design, e.g., CAN-communication with each motor independently.


A detailed explanation of hardware components is given in the `Hardware Access through Controllers design document`_.

Hardware Description in URDF
----------------------------
The ros2_control framework uses the ``<ros2_control>``-tag in the robot's URDF file to describe its components, i.e., the hardware setup.
The chosen structure enables tracking together multiple ``xacro``-macros into one without any changes.
The example hereunder shows a position-controlled robot with 2-DOF (RRBot), an external 1-DOF force-torque sensor, and an externally controlled 1-DOF parallel gripper as its end-effector.
For more examples and detailed explanations, check `ros2_control_demos`_ repository and `ROS 2 Control Components URDF Examples design document`_.

Running the Framework for Your Robot
------------------------------------
To run the ros2_control framework, do the following.
The example files can be found in the `ros2_control_demos`_ repository.

#. Create a YAML file with the configuration of the controller manager and two controllers. (`Example configuration for RRBot <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control_demos/blob/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/example_1/bringup/config/rrbot_controllers.yaml>`_)
#. Extend the robot's URDF description with needed ``<ros2_control>`` tags.
   It is recommended to use macro files (xacro) instead of pure URDF. (`Example URDF for RRBot <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control_demos/blob/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/example_1/description/ros2_control/rrbot.ros2_control.xacro>`_)
#. Create a launch file to start the node with `Controller Manager`_.
   You can use a default `ros2_control node`_ (recommended) or integrate the controller manager in your software stack.
   (`Example launch file for RRBot <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control_demos/blob/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/example_1/bringup/launch/rrbot.launch.py>`_)

*NOTE:* You could alternatively use a script to create setup a `skeleton of the "hardware_interface" package by using the scripts <https://rtw.stoglrobotics.de/master/use-cases/ros2_control/setup_robot_hardware_interface.html>`_ provided by one of our maintainers.
