Summary
-------

If you already know that the ros2_control framework acts as a Kernel for ROS 2 robotics systems you are using but need help with application complexity, then this workshop is for you. The workshop covers the use of ros2_control controllers in products from various industries and shows solutions for all the little issues when running 24/7.

You will get a practical overview of concepts like controller chaining - used for cascade control and real-time state estimators; and asynchronous and "side-load" controllers that enable you to run complex calculations without jitter in your control loops. We expect your active involvement!

Before coming to the conference
